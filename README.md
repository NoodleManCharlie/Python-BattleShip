# Python-BattleShip
12/14/2023:
I created this program a whiiiiiillllllleeeeee ago and since then I have been working on in in my free time at school, many changes have happened such as
-Saveable settings
-Multiple battleships
-Replayability
-Main menu
-Various methods of exit
-A much cleaner interface

If you would like to see what it started as before I got bored at school a couple years later, visit the "Old" branch

Next up?
Battleships of different sizes maybe?
