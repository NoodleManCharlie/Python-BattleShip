# Python-BattleShip
1 Player Battleship made with Python

I made this when I finished my Python course in order to refresh myself on what I learnt and to confirm I had learnt Python.
It is an upgraded version of what the course had walked me through

That old readme was written a whiiiiiillllllleeeeee ago and so heres an updated read-me

The old code can be found in BattleShip Functionality

During free time at school I have been improving drastically the BattleShip code and it now has many other features such as 
-Saveable settings
-Multiple battleships
-Replayability
-Main menu
-Various methods of exit
-A much cleaner interface

Next up?
Battleships of different sizes maybe?
